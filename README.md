## Technical Stack and Architecture

The BossClub app is built using a combination of modern technologies to ensure high performance and scalability:

- **Frontend**: The app's user interface is developed with Java/Kotlin ktx in Android Studio, using XML for layout design. The app follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, with Activities and Fragments managing each core feature.
- **Backend**: Firebase is used for real-time data management, authentication, and storage, allowing seamless updates and secure access control.
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore manages dynamic data storage, including user roles, events, announcements, forum posts, and budgeting records.
- **Libraries**:Firebase Authentication for secure login and user verification.
  Firebase Firestore for database management.
  RecyclerView and CardView for creating dynamic and interactive layouts.
  Glide for efficient image loading and caching.

## User Guide

- **Sign Up and Log In**: New users create an account with Firebase Authentication, while returning users can log in directly.
- **Dashboard**: Upon login, the user lands on the Dashboard, displaying key announcements, recent forum posts, and upcoming events.
- **Navigation**: The app‚Äôs bottom navigation bar includes:
- **Forum**: View posts, comment, and interact with other members.
- **Calendar**: Displays events. Users can click each event for details and RSVP.
- **Events**: Submit event requests (members) or approve pending events (admins).
- **Budget**: Leaders manage the club budget, add new expenses, or edit existing records.
- **User Roles**: Admins and Leaders have extra options like task assignment, event approval, and access to budgeting tools.
- **Log Out**: Users can log out via the settings, returning to the login screen.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Real-Time Data Synchronization**: Ensuring data consistency across devices posed challenges. Solution: Used Firebase‚Äôs real-time capabilities to update data immediately and employed local caching to handle offline scenarios.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Implementing permissions for different user roles was complex. Solution: Defined specific roles in Firestore and structured the app‚Äôs code to display features based on user roles, ensuring secure and organized data access.
- **UI Responsiveness**: Ensuring smooth UI transitions across different screen sizes and orientations required careful testing. Solution: Utilized ConstraintLayout for flexible layouts and tested on multiple devices for consistent user experience.

## Future Enhancements

- **Push Notifications**: Adding notifications for upcoming events and announcements to keep members engaged.
- **In-App Messaging**: Direct messaging feature for members to connect in real-time.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Providing club leaders with insights on event attendance, engagement metrics, and budget utilization.
- **External Calendar Sync**: Allow users to sync club events with their personal calendars for better scheduling integration.
- **Feedback System**: Implement a system for gathering member feedback on events and the app itself to guide future improvements.
- **Loading Animation**: More animations to be incorporated for better visualization.
